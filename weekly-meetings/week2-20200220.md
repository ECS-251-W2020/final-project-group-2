## What We’ve Done
* Configured Fidelius on Linux
  * Installed Ubuntu 16.04 and gcc 4.8.5 to fix the c library dependency issue from last week
  * Compiled EnclaveManager executable
  * Debugged sgx library issue
* Made some changes to Fidelius
  * Updated the chrome extension icon to the sign of Death Hallows
* Purchased Raspberry Pi 4; borrowed RPI 3
* Divided the group into three roles
  * UI (chrome extension): understood the basics of chrome extension
  * Hardware (Raspberry Pi): installed raspbian on Linux; connected RPI to Linux
  * Porting Fidelius to Windows:Installed and activated SGX driver on Windows machine

## What We’ll Do
* UI: figure out/debug Native Messaging Host; pull Enclave Manage executable
* Porting: figure out the proper c/c++ compiler/library for Windows; compile the executable 
* Hardware: figure out HDMI input 

## Issues
* Hardware: missing the HDMI input to Raspberry Pi 4
  * Original Fidelius used B101 HDMI to CSI-2 bridge, which costs $90 on mouser
  * Already asked around for the possibility of borrowing one, but negative so far
  * Emailed Sam for some advice
