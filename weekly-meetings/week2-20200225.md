## What We’ve Done
* Abandoned all Fidelius source code
  * Too many issues:
    * Strict dependency requirements: specific versions of Linux, GCC, C Libraries, Raspberry Pis, etc.
    * Requires hardware we do not possess: RPiZ, Auvidea B101 HDMI-in module, etc
    * Documentation is extremely out of date and references files/projects that no longer exist
    * Workarounds require complete rewrites anyway
    * Limited hardware options for the team to work on
* Created a new project we call "Lumos"
  * Aim to fulfill the promises of Fidelius while being more accessible
  * Completely redesign from the ground up, including architecture
    * One RPi4 (but specific device is not required) as a thin-client:
      * Runs VNC Client, Chrome, Chrome Extension, and Nodejs (No SGX)
    * One Host (Windows, MacOS, Linux compatible - just needs VNC Server and Chrome)
      * Runs VNC Server, Chrome, Chrome Extension (No SGX)
    * Enclave runs on the RPi4 and passes session cookies to HOST via HTTPS 
			         
	User_Input-->    PI    <-------VNC-------> HOST
		     (Enclave) <------HTTPS------>	
  * Completed first working prototype:
    * Three Chrome extensions built (send URL, export cookies, import cookies)
    * Nodejs server running 

## What We’ll Do
* UI: 
  * Condense three Chrome extensions down to two
  * Auto check for cookies on interval (client import extension)
  * Auto-detect login (user no longer needs to click on the extension to export)
  * Setup options menu to allow user configuration (choose network location rather than hardcode)
  * Streamline setup process

* Security (if time permitted):
  * Enable HTTPS (currently HTTP for testing)
  * Create authentication method (so that only the HOST can contact the PI)
  * Create mechanism to prevent malicious host from loading malicious site on the PI (Sandbox Chrome and user warnings)
  
* User Study: 3/2 - 3/8 (potentially 6 to 8 candidates)
  * 3/2 - 3/8: User Study (potential 6 to 8 candidates)
  * 3/2 - 3/3: preparing user study material
  * 3/4 - 3/6: conduct user study
  * 3/7 - 3/8: analyze data


## Issues
* None
