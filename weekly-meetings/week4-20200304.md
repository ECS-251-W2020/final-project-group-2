## What Weâ€™ve Done
* UI: 
  * Condense three Chrome extensions down to two
  * Auto check for cookies on interval (client import extension)
  * Auto-detect login (user no longer needs to click on the extension to export)
  * Setup options menu to allow user configuration (choose network location rather than hardcode)
* Security:
  * Enable HTTPS (currently HTTP for testing)
  * Create authentication method (so that only the HOST can contact the PI)
  * Create mechanism to prevent malicious host from loading malicious site on the PI (User warnings)
 * User Study
   * Prepared user study material
