## What We’ve Done
* Downloaded source file, installed SGX and DSK, tried to compile, and found out that there are library issues
* Contacted the original author to ask for help with the library file issues
* Found out that the project is no longer supported by original author
* Started and shared a trello
* Killed the proposal!!!
* After a grueling 2-hour meeting where we put aside Netflix, food, bathroom breaks, and all other non-essential bodily functions, we overcame geographic obstacles to create a cohesive group identity, mission statement, and modus operandi.
  * Name: Dumbledore’s Army
    * 3 Gryffindors, 2 Hufflepuffs, and 1 ~~Slytherin~~ unknown
  * Mission Statement: To create a more inclusive and safe world through the expansion of the Fidelius ~~charm~~ system to ~~muggles~~ WindowsOS.
  * MO: Defense Against the ~~Dark Arts~~ Malicious Agents and Suspicious Malware.
## What We’ll Do
* Look into a virtual machine with older versions of C libraries??
* Edit and resubmit our proposal after Algorithms midterm [no offense]
* Get Raspberry Pi?
## Issues
* Never ending rabbit hole of non-existent library files
* Certain files don’t have issues with looking at library files while other do with the same library files
  * Example
    * Birds.cpp uses include string → fine
    * Dogs.cpp uses include string → can’t find
